Key UX Elements
1. Top Navbar

Left:

Logo for “Codebase Time Machine”.

Repo name & GitHub link.

Right:

Settings icon.

Help / About button.

2. Sidebar (Navigation)

Tabs:

Timeline → Default view for evolution history.

Ownership → View hotspots and top contributors.

Complexity → View code complexity trends.

Sidebar uses minimal icons with labels, similar to Notion or Figma.

3. Timeline (Top of Main Content Area)

Horizontal timeline powered by D3.js or a similar library.

Event Types (Color Coded):

🚀 Major Feature Launch: Blue

✏️ Minor Feature: Teal

🐞 Bug Fix: Red

🔧 Refactor: Orange

🏗 Architectural Change: Purple

Hover:

Displays tooltip with event name, date, and author.

Click:

Expands details in the Event Details Panel below.

4. Event Details Panel (Bottom of Main Content Area)

Shows context for a selected timeline event:

Title: "Authentication Overhaul"

Type badge: 🚀 Major Feature Launch

Date & Author

Summary (generated by AI or parsed from commit message)

Files Changed

GitHub Commit Link

The layout mimics a GitHub Pull Request view for familiarity.

5. Visual Style

Clean SaaS look: TailwindCSS + soft background grays.

Timeline colors: vivid but not neon.

Typography: Inter or Roboto font.

Example color palette:

Event Type	Color (Hex)
Major Feature (🚀)	#3B82F6 (Blue)
Minor Feature (✏️)	#14B8A6 (Teal)
Bug Fix (🐞)	#EF4444 (Red)
Refactor (🔧)	#F97316 (Orange)

Responsive Behavior

Desktop:

Timeline + Details visible at the same time.

Tablet/Mobile:

Timeline collapses to vertical scroll.

Event details slide up as a full-screen modal.

Callouts for Replit Agent

Ensure timeline scaling adjusts dynamically for:

Projects with 100+ events → group small commits into clusters.

Projects with sparse history → show all points clearly spaced.

Use mock data from Django-CRM to test:

Example major event: Initial CRM launch.

Example refactor: Migration to new Django version.
